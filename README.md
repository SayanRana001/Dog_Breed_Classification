🐶 Dog Breed Classification using Transfer Learning
A computer vision project that classifies dog breeds from images using pre-trained deep learning models. This project leverages transfer learning techniques to achieve high accuracy with minimal training from scratch.

📌 Project Overview
The aim of this project is to build an image classification system that can accurately identify the breed of a dog from a given image. Using the power of transfer learning, we fine-tune state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) like ResNet, VGG, or EfficientNet on a labeled dataset of dog images.
